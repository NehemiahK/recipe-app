# Recipe App

## Motivation for this project 

- I wanted a super easy way to share recipes and search exisiting recipes. 
- I did not want to have rely on application that would either charge me or have my data subject to their terms.
- I might want to add more custom functionality down the road.

## Additonal Setup: 

- You will need a config folder, insider there is a keys file to put whatever keys are specific to your application. 

```
module.exports = {
    mongodburl:"",
    facebookAppId:,
    facebookAppSecret:'',
}
```
